# Dashboard Enhancements

This document outlines the enhancements made to the VAI-Liq-Planung dashboard to provide better financial insights and more useful functionality.

## New Features

### 1. Cash Flow Summary

A visual representation of income, expenses, and net cash flow over the past 6 months. The chart shows:
- Monthly inflows (green line)
- Monthly outflows (red line)
- Net cash flow (blue area chart)

This helps users visualize trends and patterns in their financial data over time.

### 2. Expense Categories Breakdown

A pie chart showing expenses broken down by category for the past 30 days. This visualization helps users:
- Identify where their money is being spent
- Highlight the largest expense categories
- Analyze spending patterns by category

The chart uses VAIOS brand colors for common categories and automatically generates colors for other categories.

### 3. Payment Due Alerts

An enhanced version of the upcoming payments section that now includes:
- Visual indicators for urgency (red for immediate, amber for soon, blue for later)
- Days until due prominently displayed
- Category labels for better context
- Sorted by urgency (most urgent first)

This helps users prioritize which payments need immediate attention.

### 4. Monthly Comparison

A new component that compares the current month's financial performance with the previous month, including:
- Income comparison
- Expense comparison
- Net cash flow comparison
- Percentage change indicators (with direction arrows)
- Color coding to indicate positive/negative changes

This helps users track month-to-month progress and identify financial trends.

### 5. Quick Action Buttons

Large, easy-to-click buttons for common actions:
- Add new transaction (accent color for emphasis)
- Go to planning view
- Manage fixed costs
- Manage employees

The buttons include icons for better visual recognition and are designed to streamline the user's workflow.

### 6. Cash Runway Indicator

A new component that shows how long the current cash reserves will last based on the current burn rate:
- Visual progress bar
- Status indicator (Critical, Tight, Adequate, Good, Excellent)
- Context of monthly expenses
- Automatically calculates months of runway

This helps users understand their financial sustainability and plan accordingly.

## Implementation Details

All new features use the VAIOS brand colors defined in the tailwind.config.js file. The dashboard now uses a more organized grid layout with three columns on desktop for better information density while maintaining readability.

The backend service `dashboard.ts` has been enhanced to provide all the necessary data for these new visualizations, including historical cash flow data, category breakdowns, and month-to-month comparisons.
