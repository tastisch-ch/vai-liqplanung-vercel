# Supabase Setup Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created Database Migrations**
   - Set up the `supabase/migrations` directory
   - Created an initial migration file (`01_initial_setup.sql`) that sets up all necessary tables with RLS policies

2. **Created Database Table Structure**
   - `profiles`: User profile information
   - `user_settings`: User settings (colors, balance)
   - `buchungen`: Transaction records
   - `fixkosten`: Fixed recurring costs
   - `mitarbeiter`: Employee information
   - `lohndaten`: Salary data
   - `simulationen`: Financial simulations
   - `scenarios`: Saved simulation scenarios

3. **Added Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Created policies for all tables to ensure data isolation between users
   - Each table has policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations

4. **Created Sample Data**
   - Added a seed file (`supabase/seed.sql`) with sample data for development
   - Designed seed data to only populate if tables are empty

5. **Created Documentation**
   - Added a README in the `supabase` directory
   - Updated the main README with Supabase setup information
   - Created a setup script with detailed instructions

6. **Added Testing and Verification**
   - Created a connection test script to verify database setup
   - Added table verification to ensure all tables exist

## Next Steps

1. **Link to Your Supabase Project**
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID --password YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
   ```

2. **Push Database Schema**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

3. **Seed Your Database (Optional)**
   ```bash
   supabase db reset
   ```

4. **Run Tests to Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-supabase-connection.js
   ```

## Important Notes

- The database schema is designed to work with existing data - it won't drop tables that already exist
- All database operations use proper Row Level Security to ensure data isolation
- The setup handles tables with foreign key relationships in the correct order
- The database follows the same structure as the original Streamlit application, making migration easier

## For Use in Production

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. You have proper backups of any existing data
2. All RLS policies are correctly applied
3. Authentication is properly set up in Supabase Auth
4. Environment variables are set in your deployment environment
